# **Linked Lists Project in C++**
 This was my Data Structures and Algorithms assignment. 
 This project is written in MinGW C++ and reads the numbers from the Sayilar.txt file, separates them into tens and ones digits, and places each digit into different singly linked lists. The tens digit is added to the upward singly linked list, while the ones digit is added to the downward singly linked list. These linked lists are stored within arrays, meaning that each row of numbers is converted into two separate linked lists and stored in arrays. The user is prompted to input two indices (Position A and Position B), and the linked lists at these positions are swapped. After the swap, the averages of the nodes in the lists are calculated, and the results are displayed. The project is optimized to work efficiently with large files and can be compiled using Makefile.
